ExplanatiON: 
The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, AND 8 have cONsecutive ids AND each of them hAS >= 100 people attended. 
Note that row 8 wAS included even though the visit_date wAS not the next day after row 7.
The rows with ids 2 AND 3 are not included because we need at leASt three cONsecutive ids.
